HTML5-Storage-Game
==================

###Concept
The concept is basically a web dev/developer 'tycoon' game, as I have always been a fan of business sim games. 

Intended to be a super basic game. Once I have that built, I will look into creating a better interface for it, perhaps using the canvas/easel.js or SVG's cause I'm good at those.

###Gameplay
The user advances day through day, each day taking roughly 5 seconds irl, randomly being assigned 'projects'. Projects take a set number of days to comlete. Upon completion, the user is awarded money and XP, both of which currently do *nothing*. The user has a set number of developers they can have working work them. These developers allow the user to take on more projects, and will soon be able to help complete projects faster.
